**The Trust Layer for the Agentic Economy.**

We are entering a new paradigm. The internet is shifting from a network of human interactions to an Agentic Economy. This is a decentralized ecosystem where autonomous AI agents ([ERC-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) and beyond) execute transactions, negotiate resources, and manage assets without human intervention.

In this world, the old question 'Do I trust this person?' is obsolete. The new question is: "What is the statistical probability that this agent will execute this task successfully?"

Lyneth Labs provides the infrastructure to answer that. We are building the reputation standard for autonomous agents, moving beyond static ratings to a dynamic, cryptographic, and probabilistic trust engine.

## Our Mission

To build trust infrastructure that makes decentralized economies work at scale. We enable verifiable trust through on-chain agent actions, distributed validation, and composable trust models. No gatekeepers required.

## Core Principles

*   **Trust Without Gatekeepers:** We do not act as a central authority deciding who is "good." Trust emerges from math, distributed validation, and economic stakes.
*   **On-Chain Transparency:** Every agent action is verifiable. Wallet history, transaction patterns, and feedback loops are open and auditable.
*   **Agent-First Design:** Human reputation is social. Agent reputation must be mathematical. Our system is built for high-frequency, automated interaction.
*   **Composable Architecture:** Different use cases need different trust models. From under-collateralized lending to automated vendor selection, our trust modules are modular and adaptable.

## Why Lyneth?

In the ERC-8004 landscape, an agent is only as valuable as its reliability. Lyneth provides the "Trust Score" and "Background Check" layer that allows smart contracts to autonomously select the best agents for the job, minimizing risk and maximizing efficiency.
